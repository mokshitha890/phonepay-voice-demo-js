# PhonePe-Style Voice Payment Notification

This project is a **voice-based payment confirmation system**, inspired by **PhonePe**. It dynamically constructs and plays audio messages for transaction confirmations, providing a seamless user experience similar to real-world digital payment applications.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Accepts user input for the transaction amount
- Breaks down numbers into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones
- Dynamically selects and plays pre-recorded audio clips for each number
- Ensures smooth audio playback for a natural-sounding notification

## ðŸ”¹ How It Works
1. The user enters an amount (0â€“9999).
2. The script breaks down the number and maps it to corresponding audio files.
3. The system plays the clips in sequence to form a complete notification, e.g.:
   **"You received 2,350 to your bank account."**

## ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack
- **JavaScript** â€“ Handles number processing and audio sequencing
- **HTML & CSS** â€“ Provides a simple, responsive UI
- **Pre-recorded audio clips** â€“ Used for dynamic voice playback
